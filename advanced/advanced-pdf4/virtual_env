1. Virtual environments make innovations for certain performance to maintain effectiveness and security.
They are used for software development and tests that make sure the software works well without damaging the software itself.
This can be done by creating a virtual environment that simulates the real environment and test the software there.
In addition, virtual environments can be used to create separate security environments that restrict access to normal information on the real system.

2. Virtual environments work by creating a layer that separates the real system and the user from the virtual environment.
 This is done by technologies like virtualization. This allows the user to operate within the virtual environment as if it were a real system, but in reality
  it is running on top of another system .

3. To create and use virtual environments, you need to download virtualization platforms such as VMware, VirtualBox. 
I can create a virtual machine by installing these software and adjust the virtual environment according to what I need.
 The virtual environment resembled a real system.

 4. I was unable to run the code immediately because the virtual environment does not contain all the libraries and 
 it is necessary to download the Threads library in order for the code to work.
